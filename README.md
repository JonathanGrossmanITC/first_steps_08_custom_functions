# Custom Functions 

Welcome to the eighth lesson! In this lesson, you learn how to write your own functions. You will study the syntax of how to write a function and learn how functions work. Then, you will see several examples of how you can use functions to enhance your projects.

The purpose of showing you examples of how you can use functions is because many different types of situations require you to use a function, and not in all situations are you going to use functions in the same way. Furthermore, you can use functions for its return a value or instead to simply perform certain tasks. Plus, while practicing writing functions, you can weave together what you learned in previous chapters. For instance, you can write functions containing conditional statements, operators, and expressions. In addition, in your functions, you can get elements by the `id`, tag type, and `class` and do other DOM manipulations. 

At the end of this lesson, you see a live coding example. The live coding session reinforces what you learn in the lesson. This lesson also helps prepare you for making your personal portfolio site. The code from this session is included in this repository. You can use it however you like, but as with any code you get from someone else, make sure you understand it well enough to explain it to someone before putting it in your own projects.  

In this lesson, you learn:  

- Hour 1: [How to Write a Function](#how-to-write-a-function)     
- Hour 2: [Examples of Functions](#examples-of-functions)   
- Hour 3: [Live Coding](#live-coding)   

The topics below outline what you learn in the live session. After the live session, you can use this material as a resource for guided self-learning. This document will serve you as a roadmap for gaining repetition with the material that you learned during the live session.
